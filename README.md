# Simple Container Website

Learn creating a simple website and hosting it using containers.

Python has become much more popular in those years and there are a lot of new frameworks out there to try. 

Besides programming in Python, I've deployed the created software using Virtual Machines, most of the time based on LXC. So I know the basic ideas of virtualization but haven't had much practice with Docker.

## Main goal

My main goal is learning new stuff. In this project I will focus on:
- Simple website using Flask/Quart
- Docker image to build.

## Log

I will try to [log](doc/log.md) all my steps, and perhaps summarize it here later.
